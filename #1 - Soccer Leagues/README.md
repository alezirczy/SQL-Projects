**1. In the "match" table, find the season with the highest average goal difference per game. Shows the season and the average goal difference (goals for - goals against) rounded to two decimal places.**
````sql

SELECT
    m2.season,
    round(AVG(m2.home_goal) - AVG(m2.away_goal),2) AS goal_difference_avg
FROM
    match AS m2

**3. Get the name of the team that has had the highest goal difference in a specific season (for example, '2013/2014'). The goal difference is calculated as the sum of the goals scored at home minus the goals conceded at home and the goals scored as away minus the goals conceded as a visitor.**
